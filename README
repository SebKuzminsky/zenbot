This configuration is for the Zenbot CNC Mini Router (2007 version)
with 7i30 driver board, using the Mesa 5i23 for pwm generation &
quadrature counting.

Each axis/joint is run by a servo controlled by a 7i30.  All the servos
have no index channel, instead the index channel is used for home/limit
switches, plus the tool length offset switch.




# Spindle

The spindle is a TB-350S from Wolfgang Engineering (Richard?).

Rated for 0.0001 runout expected, 0.0004 runout max.

20,000 or 25,000 RPM, it's unclear.

Chris Radek has one, and has worked out how to replace the spindle
bearings.




# Work holding

There is not much cutting force on the work, the main job of work holding
is to keep the copper surface parallel to XY across the whole work piece.

I used Target or Scotch branch "permanent double sided tape", it seemed
to work.

Chris Radek says:

    I use the thicker tape with filaments in it that's meant for making
    very poor quality installations of tile or maybe carpet?

# Z touch off

Bring the tool down close to the work, then raise it 0.001 at a time
until you can just barely roll a precision ground dowel pin between the
tool and the work.  The pins at SSD have a diameter of 0.250 +- 0.001.

If you don't have a dowel pin, the shank of a cutter works too but make
sure you measure the actual diameter carefully.

# Toolchain

KiCAD -> FlatCAM -> LinuxCNC


## KiCAD

Use Mounting Hole footprints for mounting holes.

Draw the board outline on the Edge.Cuts layer.

To export to FlatCAM or other board fabrication tools:

    File -> Plot
    
        select the layers, Plot

        "Generate Drill Files...", enable "PTH and NPTH holes in single
        file", "Generate Drill File"


## FlatCAM


### Load PCB fabrication files

"Open Gerber" to load the different layers.

"Open Excellon" to load the drill file.


FIXME: Somehow set the origin so it doesn't travel out of the machine's
range of motion at the end of each G-code program.  For now I just
commented out the final "G0 X0 Y0" move by hand.


### Mirror the bottom copper and the drill locations

mirror breakout-board-B.Cu.gbr -axis Y -box breakout-board-Edge.Cuts.gbr
mirror breakout-board.drl -axis Y -box breakout-board-Edge.Cuts.gbr


### Generate trace isolation geometry from copper layer

Set too diameter in B.Cu object.


### Generate geometry for irregular board outlines aka Edge Cuts

Set too diameter in Edge.Cuts object.

isolate breakout-board-Edge.Cuts.gbr -outname outline-iso
exteriors outline-iso -outname outline
delete outline-iso


### Mill holes

Set tool diameter in Drill object "Mill Holes", click Generate Geometry.


### Generate G-code

For each of the three toolpath objects (trace isolation, drill/mill, and
board outline), select the object, set CNC Job options, click Generate.

For the isolation job: Use the 0.010 endmill, "Cut Z" should be maybe
0.008, with a single pass.  (1 oz copper clad board has a 0.0014 inch
thick copper layer, and it's pretty easy to mount the board with <
0.003 inch wobble.)

For the drill/mill and board outline jobs: Use the 0.031 endmill, "Cut
Z" should be the thickness of the board + 0.005 or so, call it 0.070,
with a depth/pass of 0.020?


### Save the G-code

In each G-code object:

* Add "G20 G64 P.0005" to "Prepend to G-code".

* Add "M2" to "Append to G-code".

* Click "Export G-Code".


# FlatCAM fixes

* Actual helix milling for the holes
