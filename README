This configuration is for the Zenbot CNC Mini Router (2007 version)
with 7i30 driver board, using the Mesa 5i23 for pwm generation &
quadrature counting.

Each axis/joint is run by a servo controlled by a 7i30.  All the servos
have no index channel, instead the index channel is used for home/limit
switches, plus the tool length offset switch.


# Spindle

The spindle is a TB-350S from Wolfgang Engineering (Richard?).

Rated for 0.0001 runout expected, 0.0004 runout max.

20,000 or 25,000 RPM, it's unclear.

Chris Radek has one, and has worked out how to replace the spindle
bearings.


# Work holding

There is not much cutting force on the work, the main job of work holding
is to keep the copper surface parallel to XY across the whole work piece.

I used Target or Scotch branch "permanent double sided tape", it seemed
to work.

Chris Radek says:

    I use the thicker tape with filaments in it that's meant for making
    very poor quality installations of tile or maybe carpet?

# Z touch off

Bring the tool down close to the work, then raise it 0.001 at a time
until you can just barely roll a precision ground dowel pin between the
tool and the work.  The shank of a cutter works too.
