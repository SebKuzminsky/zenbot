This configuration is for the Zenbot CNC Mini Router (2007 version)
with 7i30 driver board, using the Mesa 5i23 for pwm generation &
quadrature counting.

Each axis/joint is run by a servo controlled by a 7i30.  All the servos
have no index channel, instead the index channel is used for home/limit
switches, plus the tool length offset switch.
