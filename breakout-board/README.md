This is a breakout board for connecting the Zenbot to a Mesa FPGA board.

It connects to a standard 50-pin ribbon cable from the Mesa FPGA board.

It passes the servo pins for channels 0, 1, and 2 to a second 50-pin
connector, for connecting to the 7i30 and driving the X, Y, and Z servos.

The remaining FPGA connector pins connect to screw terminals, for
additional IO (eg the control line for an SSR to power the spindle).

The servo control pins are:

    1-23, 29, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47 (and 49)

The GPIO pins are:

    25, 27, 33, 37, 41, 45 (and 49)

The male 50-pin connectors are TE Part #1-5499923-0

The screw terminals are Phoenix Contact Part #1725711
